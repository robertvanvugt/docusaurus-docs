# Introduction

This site provides the official documentation for the **platform products** developed and maintained by the Public Cloud & Platform Engineering team.

These platform products are reusable, cloud-native building blocks designed to accelerate teams across the organization by providing secure, compliant, and opinionated “paved paths” for common cloud use cases.

They cover areas such as:

- **Managed Landing Zones** — standardized Azure foundations with governance, security, and networking baked in.
- **CloudOps** — operational capabilities for monitoring, security, compliance, lifecycle management, and automation.
- Platform services and integrations that enable teams to build, deploy, and operate workloads safely and consistently.

## Purpose of this site

The goal of this documentation is to:

- Make platform capabilities **discoverable** and easy to understand.
- Provide clear guidance on how to **consume and integrate** platform products.
- Explain design principles, constraints, and operational responsibilities.
- Enable teams to self-serve wherever possible.

This site is intended for engineers, architects, product teams, and operations teams who build on top of the platform or integrate with it.

## Scope

The documentation focuses on:

- How platform products are designed and how they should be used.
- Interfaces, inputs, outputs, and integration patterns.
- Supported use cases and non-goals.
- Operational and compliance considerations where relevant.

It does **not** aim to replace application-level documentation or team-specific runbooks, but instead acts as the shared reference for the platform itself.
